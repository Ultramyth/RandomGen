$origin
<b>Aberration.</b> The item was created by aberrations in ancient times, possibly for the use of favored humanoid thralls. When seen from the corner of the eye, the item seems to be moving.
<b>Human.</b> The item was created during the heyday of a fallen human kingdom, or it is tied to a human of legend. It might hold writing in a forgotten tongue or symbols whose significance is lost to the ages.
<b>Celestial.</b> The item is half the normal weight and inscribed with feathered wings, suns, and other symbols of good. Fiends find the item's presence repulsive.
<b>Dragon.</b> This item is made from scales and talons shed by a dragon. Perhaps it incorporates precious metals and gems from the dragon 's hoard. It grows slightly warm when within 120 feet of a dragon.
<b>Drow.</b> The item is half the normal weight. It is black and inscribed with spiders and webs in honor of Lolth. It might function poorly, or disintegrate, if exposed to sunlight for 1 minute or more.
<b>Dwarf.</b> The item is durable and has Dwarven runes worked into its design. It might be associated with a clan that would like to see it returned to their ancestral halls.
<b>Elemental Air.</b> The item is half the normal weight and feels hollow. If it 's made of fabric, it is diaphanous.
<b>Elemental Earth.</b> This item might be crafted from stone. Any cloth or leather elements are studded with finely polished rock.
<b>Elemental Fire.</b> This item is warm to the touch, and any metal parts are crafted from black iron. Sigils of flames cover its surface. Shades of red orange are the prominent colors.
<b>Elemental Water.</b> Lustrous fish scales replace leather or cloth on this item, and metal portions are instead crafted from seashells and worked coral as hard as any metal.
<b>Elf.</b> The item is half the normal weight. It is adorned with symbols of nature: leaves, vines, stars, and the like.
<b>Fey.</b> The item is exquisitely crafted from the finest materials and glows with a pale radiance moonlight, shedding dim light in a 5-foot radius. Any metal in the item is silver or mithral, rather than iron or steel.
<b>Fiend.</b> The item is made of black iron or horn inscribed with runes, and any cloth or leather components are crafted from the hide of fiends is warm to the touch and features leering faces. Vile runes engraved on its surface. Celestials find the item 's presence repulsive.
<b>Giant.</b> The item is larger than normal and was crafted by giants for use by their smaller allies.
<b>Gnome.</b> The item is crafted to appear ordinary it might look worn. It could also incorporate gears and mechanical components, even if these are not essential to the item's function.
<b>Undead.</b> The item incorporates imagery of death, such as bones and skulls, and it might be crafted from parts of corpses. It feels cold to the touch.
<b>Accidental.</b> This item was never deliberately enchanted, but acquired its magic by chance. Perhaps it sat for ages amidst other magics, absorbing their energy, or was used to strike a death blow against a fiend performing some great ritual. It likely appears old and used, but still in good condition.
<b>Ancestral Bloodline.</b> Crafted for a particular family, this item gained its magic from multiple generations of their belief and veneration. It bears a family crest, though it may not be immediately obvious. Members of the bloodline want it returned if they learn of it, and others might assume the bearer is related to the original family.
<b>Aquatic.</b> Crafted by merfolk, tritons, or similar aquatic (but non-elemental) races, this item is made of coral, sea plants, and scales. Using this item underwater does not impose disadvantage even if it normally would (such as attacking with certain weapons), nor does it count toward encumbrance for determining penalties to swimming.
<b>Dawncraft.</b> This ancient item comes from the dawn of the humanoid age, before humans, elves, and dwarves became—culturally, physically, even mentally—what they are today. It is crude, crafted of bone, stone, or poorly tanned animal pelt, and may be adorned with feathers, small bones, or other fetishes.
<b>Divine Gift.</b> No mortal hands crafted this item. It was placed by the gods themselves, or agents thereof, for mortals to find—perhaps intended for a great hero on a legendary quest, or maybe simply to see what they’ll do with it. The item is impossibly perfect in all respects. It doubles as a (non-magical) holy symbol.
<b>Futurecraft.</b> This item is from the future, or from a civilization far beyond the world on which it was found. Its magics might be activated by small buttons or switches. Its lines are sleek, its metals and fabrics unidentifiable, and may even consist of substances completely unknown to the campaign setting.
<b>Incarnated Magic.</b> The item sprang forth whole, its physical and mystical properties already intact, from more powerful magic, such as a Wish or a lucky draw from a Deck of Many Things. Most such item are remarkably plain, lacking any artistic flourish or individual touch.
<b>Legendary Crafter.</b> Spoken of in history, legend, and song, a nigh-mythical smith or crafter created this item. So skilled was this artisan that items they created were innately magical, requiring no ritual or enchantment to gain their power. This item is expertly made, and bears the personal sigil of its creator.
<b>Offering.</b> One race or culture made this item as a gift to another, perhaps to commemorate a treaty, as a sign of friendship, or under duress. Choose two appropriate origins from these tables, one as the giver and one as the receiver; the item has some traits of both.
<b>Orc.</b> This item is crude, with ragged edges and dangling strips of material, but brutally functional. If a weapon, it grows warm whenever it delivers a critical hit. Orcs react with hostility to an non-orc displaying the item.
<b>Planar Battlefield.</b> The afterlives of several gods or pantheons are everlasting battlefields, where souls are reborn every morning to fight again. This item is a creation of one of those planes, intended to equip its eternal warriors. It bears the symbols of that plane or its gods.
<b>Planar Echo.</b> This is a “copy” of a mundane item from the material plane, native to the Plane of Shadow, the Plane of the Fey, or other echoes of the real world. Due to planar vagaries, this copy is magical even though the original is not. Items native to Shadow are dim, lighter than expected, and cold to the touch. Those native to the world of the Fey resemble fey-made items (see the DMG), but occasionally change shape or color.
<b>Servant of Chaos.</b> This item is made of strange, unidentifiable materials. Its design is uneven, imbalanced, with excessive parts or flourishes that serve no obvious purpose. Extraplanar creatures of Law find its presence repulsive.
<b>Servant of Order.</b> Minimalist and straightforward, symmetrical and technically perfect, this item strikes a precise balance between form and function. Extraplanar creatures of Chaos find its presence repulsive.
<b>Shapeshifter.</b> This item appears to be an average example of its type. When wielded by a shapeshifter, such as a doppelganger, it changes appearance to match whatever guise the wielder assumes, even if items are normally excluded from that change. The item’s basic nature is not affected, only the specifics of its appearance.
<b>Titan.</b> Made either by the creations of the gods themselves, for use by their servants, or by mortals who venerate them, this item bears icons of religious significance, forgotten history, and possibly of widespread destruction. It weighs 20% more than normal items of its type. If this item deals damage, it does one additional point of damage per attack or per spell against inanimate objects.
<b>Vestige.</b> Created by the fading remnants of a forgotten god, or by one of its few surviving adherents, this item feels almost insubstantial. It weighs half as much as a normal item of its type, and often seems on the verge of fading away entirely. When in the area of detect magic or similar effects, there is a 10% chance that the item fails to register as magical.

$minor property
<b>Artful.</b> The bearer is proficient in one tool or set of tools, of the GM’s choice, while the item is on the bearer’s person.
<b>Beckoner.</b> If the item is separated from the bearer, the bearer instinctively knows the item’s direction and rough distance. This knowledge lasts for 24 hours or until the item is attuned to someone else, whichever comes first.
<b>Brave.</b> When the bearer of this item contemplates or undertakes a cowardly act—or even a neutral act, when a more daring option is available—the item enhances feelings of shame and guilt.
<b>Bulwark.</b> If the item is in the bearer’s possession for the entirety of a long rest, the item grants the bearer 5 temporary hit points at the conclusion of that rest. If not used, these hit points fade in 24 hours.
<b>Cowardly.</b> When the bearer is presented with an opportunity to act in a cowardly or self-preserving manner, the item heightens the bearer’s urge to do so.
<b>Devoted.</b> The item fights to remain attuned to its current bearer. The item must be separated from the bearer for 48 hours, rather than the standard 24, to break the attunement. If a new individual attempts to attune the item when a prior attunement is still in effect, the individual must succeed on a DC 14 Charisma check at the end of that short rest. On a failure, the item fails to attune to the new owner, remaining attuned to the old.
<b>Enigmatic.</b> Neither examination over the course of a short rest, nor identify or similar magics, reveal this item’s properties. The bearer can learn those properties only through attunement or trial and error.
<b>Fastidious.</b> Once per day, as an action, the bearer can magically clean themselves, their outfit, and the item itself of dirt, grime, sweat, and so forth. This power resets at dawn.
<b>Focused.</b> The bearer of this item gains a +1 bonus to Constitution saving throws made to avoid losing concentration on an ongoing spell.
<b>Gloom-Sight.</b> If the bearer of this item possesses darkvision, the effective distance of that darkvision increases by 20 feet while the item is on the bearer’s person. It does not, however, grant darkvision to a bearer who does not already possess it.
<b>Hardy.</b> If the item is in the bearer’s possession for the entirety of a long rest, then at the conclusion of that rest, the item grants the bearer one extra hit die, which can be spent as normal to regain hit points during a short rest. If not used, this extra hit die disappears in 24 hours.
<b>Lodestar.</b> This item is linked to a specific location or object, determined by the GM. The bearer can use an action to determine the distance and direction to that place or object. The item does not grant the bearer any specific knowledge of what that item or place might be.
<b>Restful.</b> If the item is in the bearer’s possession since the beginning of a long rest, the bearer requires only six hours to gain the benefit of that rest, rather than the standard eight. The bearer can still gain the benefits of a long rest only once per day.
<b>Resuscitator.</b> If the item is in the bearer’s possession, the bearer gains a +2 bonus to the first death save made that day. This power resets at dawn.
<b>Schemer.</b> As an action while the item is on the bearer’s person, the bearer may choose one individual within both sight and earshot. Until the bearer ends the effect (no action required) or a full minute passes, anything the bearer says is heard only by that individual, not by anyone else. (This is a one-way effect only.) This power can be used once a day and resets at dawn.
<b>Skillful.</b> The bearer gains a +1 bonus to ability checks using one specific skill, of the GM’s choice, while the item is on the bearer’s person.
<b>Speedy.</b> As an action while the item is on the bearer’s person, the bearer may gain a +5 to walking speed. This bonus lasts until the bearer deactivates it (no action required). The item grants this bonus up to a maximum total duration of one minute per day, resetting at dawn.
<b>Suppressible.</b> As an action, the bearer may suppress the item’s magic, in its entirety, for a preset amount of time (up to 24 hours). During that time, the item behaves as a non-magical item, cannot be attuned by anyone (though existing attunement does not end), and does not register as magical to detect magic, identify, or any other spells or abilities that detect magic. The effect cannot be ended prematurely; it lasts for the duration specified when activated.
<b>Unwavering.</b> The item grants the bearer an extra sliver of luck to slightly mitigate unfavorable conditions. When the bearer makes [an] [attack rolls|saving throws|ability check] roll with disadvantage, the item grants a +1 bonus on that roll.
<b>Resuscitator.</b> If you fail a death saving throw, you can choose to succeed instead. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.
<b>Beacon.</b> The bearer can use a bonus action to cause the item to shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional10 feet, or to extinguish the light.
<b>Compass. The wielder can use an action to learn which way is north.
<b>Conscientious.</b> When the bearer of this item contemplates or undertakes a malevolent act, the item enhances pangs of conscience.
<b>Delver.</b> While underground, the bearer of this item always knows the item's depth below the surface and the direction to the nearest staircase, ramp, or other path leading upward.
<b>Gleaming.</b> This item never gets dirty.
<b>Guardian.</b> The item whispers warnings to its bearer, granting a +2 bonus to initiative if the bearer isn't incapacitated.
<b>Harmonious.</b> Attuning to this item takes only 1 minute.
<b>Hidden Message.</b> A message is hidden somewhere on the item. It might be visible only at a certain time of the year, under the light of one phase of the moon, or in a specific location.
<b>Key.</b> The item is used to unlock a container, chamber, vault, or other entryway.
<b>Language.</b> The bearer can speak and understand a language of the DM's choice while the item is on the bearer's person.
<b>Sentinel.</b> This item glows faintly when [bane] are within 120 feet of it.
<b>Song Craft.</b> Whenever this item is struck or is used to strike a foe, its bearer hears a fragment of an ancient song.
<b>Strange Material.</b> The item was created from a material that is bizarre given its purpose. Its durability is unaffected.
<b>Temperate.</b> The bearer suffers no harm in temperatures as cold as -20 degrees Fahrenheit or as warm as 120 degrees Fahrenheit.
<b>Unbreakable.</b> The item can't be broken. Special means must be used to destroy it.
<b>War Leader.</b> The bearer can use an action to cause his or her voice to carry clearly for up to 300 feet until the end of the bearer's next turn.
<b>Waterborne.</b> This item floats on water and other liquids. Its bearer has advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks to swim.
<b>Wicked.</b> When the bearer is presented with an opportunity to act in a selfish or malevolent way, the item heightens the bearer's urge to do so.
<b>Illusion.</b> The item is imbued with illusion magic, allowing its bearer to alter the item's appearance in minor ways. Such alterations don't change how the item is worn, carried, or wielded, and they have no effect on its other magical properties. For example, the wearer could make a red robe appear blue, or make a gold ring look like it's made of ivory. The item reverts to its true appearance when no one is carrying or wearing it.

$history
<b>Arcane.</b> This item was created for an ancient order of spellcasters and bears the order's symbol.
<b>Bane.</b> This item was created by the foes of [bane]. If the culture or creatures are still around, they might recognize the item and single out the bearer as an enemy.
<b>Heroic.</b> A great hero once wielded this item. Anyone who's familiar with the item's history expects great deeds from the new owner.
<b>Ornament.</b> The item was created to honor a special occasion . Inset gemstones, gold or platinum inlays, and gold or silver filigree adorn its surface.
<b>Prophecy.</b> The item features in a prophecy: its bearer is destined to play a key role in future events. Someone else who wants to play that role might try to steal the item, or someone who wants to prevent the prophecy from being fulfilled might try to kill the item 's bearer.
<b>Religious.</b> This item was used in religious ceremonies dedicated to a particular deity. It has holy symbols worked into it. The god's followers might try to persuade its owner to donate it to thier temple, steal the item for themselves, or celebrate its use by a cleric or paladin of the same deity.
<b>Sinister.</b> This item is linked to a deed of great evil such as a massacre or an assassination. It might have a name or be closely associated with a villain who used it. Anyone familiar with the item's history is likely to treat it and its owner with suspicion.
<b>Symbol of Power.</b> This item was once used as part of royal regalia or as a badge of high office. Its former owner or that person's descendants might desire it, or someone might mistakenly assume new owner is the item's legitimate inheritor.
<b>Champion’s Prize.</b> The item was once presented as a reward to the winner of a famous competition: a series of games and sporting events with competitors from multiple kingdoms, the first successful completion of an arduous religious rite, a scavenger hunt put on by multiple guilds, or the like. Depending on the significance of the competition and how long ago it occurred, this could simply be an interesting piece of trivia, or it could have major repercussions for the wielder, who might be seen as unworthy or a pretender to unearned glory. 
<b>Conflict.</b> This item was the spark that ignited some sort of conflict, as different sides or factions vied to acquire it. This might have been as minor as a social struggle between two politicians or local guilds, or as large as a full-scale war. People often expect strife and struggle to follow the item and its wielder, especially if the item doesn’t seem potent or important enough to have been worth such effort and violence. 
<b>Hero’s Victory.</b> Whether used to slay an infamous monster or taken from that monster’s hoard, this item represents a great victory over a destructive or evil force. It is, in the minds of those who recognize it, associated with that specific event, rather than the identity of the adventurer who won that victory. People may expect the current wielder to perform feats of equal valor, and those with a tie to the original hero—or the monster or villain—may become hostile. 
<b>Incomplete.</b> Although still fully functional, the item is incomplete. A sword might be missing its pommel; a shield might be short a strap; a bag might lack a clasp or a tie. Was the item created this way, or has the absent bit been deliberately removed? Why? Is anything unusual destined to occur if the item is ever fully restored? 
<b>Monstrous Materials.</b> This item is crafted, in whole or in part, from the remains of monsters. A cloak might be made from the leathery wings of a chimera, for instance, or a blade from the shell of an iron golem. Other creatures of that type, if intelligent enough to recognize it, likely don’t take kindly to anyone wielding such a thing, while common folk assume the wielder, as an obvious hunter of vile creatures, will be eager to aid them with their own monster problems. 
<b>Part of a Set.</b> This was crafted as part of a set of matching items. A magical weapon might have been forged along with a specific shield and suit of armor. Magical boots or a haversack might have been part of a complete outfit. The items all have similar design, and likely bear specific marks. Matching up items of the same set, assuming they all still exist, likely has no benefit other than aesthetics—but then again, they just might boast some additional power when combined that they lack when separated. 
<b>Remnant.</b> This item is one of the last surviving relics of a community, a culture, or even an entire region that has since been lost, either through natural disaster, war, or similar catastrophe. It carries an almost palpable sense of woe. Historians and any survivors of the disaster might seek to obtain the item for themselves, even if only to ensure this last trace of a dead people is never lost. 
<b>Resemblance.</b> For whatever reason—be it artistic inspiration, simple coincidence, or deliberate deception—this item looks almost exactly like another, much more important or powerful magic item, such as a historical treasure or even an artifact. Those who seek this item’s “twin” are unlikely to believe the wielder’s claims that this isn’t the genuine article.

$quirk
<b>Blissful.</b> While in possession of the item, the bearer feels fortunate and optimistic about what the future holds. Butterflies and other harmless creatures might frolic in the item 's presence.
<b>Confident.</b> The item helps its bearer feel self-assured.
<b>Covetous.</b> The item 's bearer becomes obsessed with material wealth.
<b>Frail.</b> The item crumbles, frays , chips, or cracks slightly when wielded, worn, or activated. This quirk has no effect on its properties, but if the item has seen much use, it looks decrepit.
<b>Hungry.</b> This item's magical properties function only if fresh blood from a humanoid has been applied to it within the past 24 hours. It needs only a drop to activate.
<b>Loud.</b> The item makes a loud noise-such as a clang, a shout, or a resonating gong-when used.
<b>Metamorphic.</b> The item periodically and randomly alters its appearance in slight ways. The bearer has no control over these minor alterations, which have no effect on the item's use.
<b>Muttering.</b> The item grumbles and mutters. A creature who listens carefully to the item might learn something useful.
<b>Painful.</b> The bearer experiences a harmless flash of pain when using the item.
<b>Possessive.</b> The item demands attunement when first wielded or worn, and it doesn't allow its bearer to attune to other items. (Other items already attuned to the bearer remain so until their attunement ends.)
<b>Repulsive.</b> The bearer feels a sense of distaste when in contact with the item, and continues to sense discomfort while bearing it.
<b>Slothful.</b> The bearer of this item feels slothful and lethargic. While attuned to the item, the bearer requires 10 hours to finish a long rest.
<b>Aesthetic.</b> While in possession of this item, the bearer becomes exceptionally fascinated by sights of beauty—artwork, scenic vistas, lush growth—and feels the urge to take every opportunity to stop and appreciate them. 
<b>Affectionate.</b> The GM selects one of the bearer’s companions at random. While in possession of the item, the bearer feels intense affection for this individual, above and beyond that felt for other members of the party, and makes every effort to perform little favors and services for, and to protect, that individual. 
<b>Bearer’s Mark.</b> The item physically marks the bearer for as long as it remains in the bearer’s possession. This might take the form of a tattoo or brand, an unnatural change in eye or hair color, a slight alteration in the shape of a facial feature (such as the ears becoming pointed if the item is elven-made), or the like. This change is always minor, but noticeable. 
<b>Devout.</b> The bearer must recite a prayer to one or more of the gods (of the bearer’s choice) before a long rest or else the bearer gains no benefit from that rest. The bearer must have given up the item at least 24 hours prior before this requirement fades. 
<b>Dreamer.</b> The item imposes unnatural dreams. The bearer might dream in a different language, or in unidentifiable colors, or even using senses the bearer doesn’t actually possess. This has no effect on the quality of the bearer’s rest. 
<b>Empathic.</b> This item changes appearance to match the bearer’s mood. Sadness might cause the item to appear worn and to turn blue, happiness might cause it to gleam brightly, anger might make it turn red and radiate heat, and so forth. These alterations are purely cosmetic, and do not alter the item’s function in any way. 
<b>Leech.</b> The item feeds off healing magics cast on the bearer. Any spell or magical effect that cures injury restores one fewer hit point than normal to the bearer. (For instance, a cure wounds spell that heals 14 points of damage due to the roll of the dice would instead heal only 13.) 
<b>Mirrored.</b> While the item is in the bearer’s possession, the bearer changes dominant hands. (That is, a right-handed bearer becomes left-handed, and vice-versa.) 
<b>Odorous.</b> The item emits a constant odor, determined by the GM when the item is created. This might be a pleasant floral scent, an animal musk, a miasma of rot, or the like. Depending on the scent, insects or small animals might be attracted to, or repelled by, the item. 
<b>Prim.</b> The item imposes a harmless but intense flash of pain on the bearer any time the bearer tells a lie, utters a profanity, fails to show proper respect to an important individual, or generally behaves in a rude or indecorous manner. 
<b>Ravenous.</b> The item imposes a constant hunger. While the item is in the bearer’s possession, the bearer must consume half again (that is, 150%) as much food and water per day as is normal. 
<b>Restless.</b> The item desperately wants to be used. (Activated, if it’s an item with charges, for instance; or wielded or worn in combat if it’s a weapon or armor.) If the bearer goes 24 hours without using the item, the item bestows a level of exhaustion on the bearer that disappears the moment the item is used, and can be eliminated in no other fashion.
